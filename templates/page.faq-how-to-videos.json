Sometimes in difficult installations caused by structural obstacles Semi Rigid is required. By Semi rigid, we do not mean fully flexible ducting which is available in the market. This can result in a noisy, vibrating hood that has limited extraction capabilities. Thickness of the ducting, we refer to as ‘gauge’. A thick gauge is required for Sirius hoods as the hoods have a very high airflow which can increase vibration. The thicker ducting counteracts this effect, minimizing noise. The diameter of your ducting is determined by the outlet on your hood. Sirius hoods have a diameter of either 150mm or 200mm ducting. Other brands sometimes use a 125mm. We cater for this size also. Where possible, we recommend NOT reducing the ducting diameter during the installation as it reduces the airflow of your hood and can make your hood noisier.<\/p>",
